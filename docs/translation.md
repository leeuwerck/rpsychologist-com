# Help to translate

Currently the [Cohen's *d* visualization](https://rpsychologist.com/cohend) has i18n support, and any help with translating the contents is very appreciated!


## Steps
1. Join the project over at Crowding:
    - [Join as a translator](https://crwd.in/rpsychologist-cohend)
    - [Join as a proofreader](https://crowdin.com/project/rpsychologist-cohend/invite?d=7565g66576k5l5b3c3r473r4b3)
2. Tell me to add your language, if it isn't already added to the project
3. Start translating

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

## Attribution
The translation will be attributed to you on the translated page, e.g., "translated by Your Name". I can link to your webpage and/or Twitter if you'd like.

```yaml

Let me know if you don't want to be mentioned as a translator.
