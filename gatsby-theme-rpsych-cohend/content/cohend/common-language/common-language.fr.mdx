With a Cohen's <em>d</em> of {props.cohend}, {props.U3} of the "{props.muOneLabel}" group will be above the mean of the "{props.muZeroLabel}" group (Cohen's U<sub>3</sub>), {props.propOverlap} of the two groups will overlap, and there is a {props.CL} chance that a person picked at random from the treatment group will have a higher score than a person picked at random from the control group (probability of superiority). Moreover, in order to have one more favorable outcome in the treatment group compared to the control group, we need to treat <IsInfinite value={props.NNT}>an infinite number of</IsInfinite> people on average. This means that if there are 100 people in each group, and we assume that {props.CER} people have favorable outcomes in the "{props.muZeroLabel}" group, then {props.CER} + {props.NNTPerc} people in the "{props.muOneLabel}" group will have favorable outcomes.<sup>1</sup>

<Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
<sup>1</sup>The values are averages, and it is assumed that {props.CER} (CER) of the "{props.muZeroLabel}" group have "favorable outcomes," i.e., their outcomes are below some cut-off. Change this by pressing the settings symbol to the right of the slider. Allez dans la section 'formules' pour plus d'informations.
