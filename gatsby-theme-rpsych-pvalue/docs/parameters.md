# Parameters

(These parameter names are likely used inconsistently at the moment.)

To avoid having to constantly recalculating the samples, they are always 
drawn under H0 and are we shift the whole layer based on H1.

* `Z`: the correct value H0 + H1 shift
* `zOrigin`: the value based on H0
* `zShifted`
* `shift`: is M1 - M0
* `xMeanCentered`: is the centered sample mean
* `xMeanOirgin`: sample mean under H0  
* `xMeanPx`: Is the pixel position within the sample layer
